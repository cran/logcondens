logcondens_2.0.3:
---------------------------------
- Contains final JSS paper version.

logcondens_2.0.2:
---------------------------------
- Added functions ROCx() and logConROC()
- Added dataset 'pancreas'

logcondens_2.0.1:
---------------------------------
- Revision according to reviewer comments for JSS paper.
- Replaced 'vectorToString()' by 'paste()' using option 'collapse'
- Added JSS paper as a vignette to the package

logcondens_2.0.0:
---------------------------------
- Substantially reworked version according to revision of paper Duembgen and Rufibach (2010).
- Updated Taylor approximations according to technical report Duembgen et al (2010).

logcondens_1.3.5:
---------------------------------
- Added 'reliability' and 'brightstar' datasets.
- Added 'logconSmoothed'.
- Added 'rlogcon'.

logcondens_1.3.4:
---------------------------------
- Included vignette in the package.

logcondens_1.3.3:
---------------------------------
- Updated references.
- Updated vignette.

logcondens_1.3.2:
---------------------------------
- Updated references.

logcondens_1.3.1:
---------------------------------
- Updated contact informations.

logcondens_1.3.0:
---------------------------------
- Modified quantilesLogConDens. Value for p0 > 1 is set to +Inf.
- Added the functions intF and intECDF.
- Updated references.

logcondens_1.2:
---------------------------------
- Simplified evaluateLogConDens and quantilesLogConDens. Therefore, J00 was slightly generalized to variable upper
  endpoint and the function qloglin was introduced.
- Replaced the variable name F for the estimated distribution function by Fhat.
- Shortened title.

logcondens_1.1:
---------------------------------
- Specified affiliations.
- Indicated that MatLab files are available upon request from Lutz Duembgen.
- MLE: printed only L, but needs to print L_new; and print = 1 replaced by print = TRUE.
- icmaLogCon: replaced ambiguous option "robust" by "robustif" (there is already a function called "robust")
- LocalMLE: replaced explicit calculations by function call to LocalConvexity.
- Help files: reformulated and complemented some entries.
- Vignette: corrected some typos.

logcondens_1.0 (initial version):
---------------------------------
- Provide functions to estimate a log-concave probability density.
